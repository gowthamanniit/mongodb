MongoDB Configuration
=======================
Step 1: Locate the folder where you have installed MongoDB.
      C:\Program Files\MongoDB
      Here you need to create couple of folders that we need for MongoDB configuration.
      1. Create two folders here, name them data and log.
      2. Create another folder inside data and name it as db, that’s where all the data will be stored.
      That’s it close the window.
Step 2: Open command prompt (right click and run as administrator). 
Navigate to the bin folder of MongoDB. 
The path to the bin folder may be different in your case based on where you have installed the MongoDB.

c:/windows/system32> cd..
c:/windows>cd..
c:/>cd program files/mongodb/server/5.3/bin
c:/program files/mongodb/server/5.3/bin>

Step 3: Configure the data & log folder and set MongoDB as service by typing this command. 
        Note: This is a one line command.

mongod --directoryperdb --dbpath "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\data\db" --logpath "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\log\mongo.log" --logappend --rest --install

ex:
c:/program files/mongodb/server/5.3/bin>mongod --directoryperdb --dbpath "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\data\db" --logpath "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\log\mongo.log" --logappend --rest --install

Step 4: Now you can start MongoDB as a service by typing this command:

net start MongoDB

ex:
c:/program files/mongodb/server/5.3/bin>net start MongoDB

That’s it everything is done. Now we should be working in the MongoDB shell and we can run that by typing this command within the bin directory.

ex:
c:/program files/mongodb/server/5.3/bin>mongo

exit or close mongodb
ex:
c:/program files/mongodb/server/5.3/bin>net stop MongoDB
