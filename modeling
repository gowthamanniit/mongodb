Data in MongoDB has a flexible schema.documents in the same collection. 
They do not need to have the same set of fields or structure Common fields in a collection’s 
documents may hold different types of data.

Data Model Design

MongoDB provides two types of data models: — 

1) Embedded data model and 2)Normalized data model.

1) Embedded Data Model or de-normalized data
In this model, you can have (embed) all the related data in a single document, 
it is also known as de-normalized data model.

For example, assume we are getting the details of employees 
in three different documents namely, Personal_details, Contact and, Address, 
you can embed all the three documents in a single one as shown below −

{
	_id: (objectid),
	Emp_ID: "10025AE336"
	Personal_details:{
		First_Name: "gowthaman",
		Last_Name: "ajay",
		Date_Of_Birth: "1995-09-26"
	},
	Contact: {
		e-mail: "ajay_s.123@gmail.com",
		phone: "933333333434"
	},
	Address: {
		city: "cheeni",
		Area: "mainroad",
		State: "Tamilnadu"
	}
}


2) Normalized Data Model
In this model, you can refer the sub documents in the original document, using references. 
For example, you can re-write the above document in the normalized model as:

Employee:

{
	_id: <ObjectId101>,
	Emp_ID: "10025AE336"
}
Personal_details:

{
	_id: <ObjectId102>,
	empDocID: " ObjectId101",
	First_Name: "Radhika",
	Last_Name: "Sharma",
	Date_Of_Birth: "1995-09-26"
}
Contact:

{
	_id: <ObjectId103>,
	empDocID: " ObjectId101",
	e-mail: "radhika_sharma.123@gmail.com",
	phone: "9848022338"
}
Address:

{
	_id: <ObjectId104>,
	empDocID: " ObjectId101",
	city: "Hyderabad",
	Area: "Madapur",
	State: "Telangana"
}
