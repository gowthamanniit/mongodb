What is a schema?
A schema defines the structure of your collection documents. A Mongoose schema maps directly to a MongoDB collection.

example:
const blog = new Schema({
title: String,
slug: String,
published: Boolean,
author: String,
content: String,
tags: [String],
createdAt: Date,
updatedAt: Date,
comments: [{
   user: String,
   content: String,
   votes: Number
  }]
});

With schemas, we define each field and its data type. Permitted types are:

String
Number
Date
Buffer
Boolean
Mixed
ObjectId
Array
Decimal128
Map
