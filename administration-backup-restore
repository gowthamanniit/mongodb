Data backup is one of the most highly required processes for any database management system 
as data can be lost or get corrupted to overcome these drawbacks we need database backup. 
Database backup is a copy of a database that already exists. 
In MongoDB, mongodump tool is used to take the data backup. 
And mongorestore tool is used to restore the backup data.
In MongoDB, mongodump tool is used to take the data backup. 
It simply dumps all the data stored into a dump directory of MongoDB. 
Backed-up data is in BSON format also known as BSON data dumps. 
By default, the backup is stored in mongodb’s bin\dump folder 
to specify a different output directory we can use the –out option. 
Mongodump is used in two ways with or without argument.

1)Without Argument:
=================
Without any arguments, mongodump connects with MongoDB instance
on the local system on port 27017 and 
creates a backup of every database and every collection.

ex:mongodump
2) With Argument: 
====================
By specifying the database in the argument by which 
we can limit the amount of data stored in the database dump

ex: mongodump --db databaseName --collection collectionName

To specify a different output directory we can use the –out option:

ex: mongodump –db databaseName –collection collectionName –out c:\backup
Example 1: Backing up all the databases (your dir-not default dir)
========================================
ex: mongodump --out c:\backupDatabase
Example 2: Backing up the specified collection
================================================
mongodump –db student –collection detail –out c:\Gowthamanbackup 

Data Restoration
=================
In MongoDB, mongorestore utility is used to restore the backup data.
It restores the binary backup created by mongodump utility(i.e., BSON data dumps)

To restore all the database use –

ex: mongorestore dump(default folder)
=======================================

To restore a specific collection use-

mongorestore  –db databaseName –collection collectionName directory\collectionName.bson

ex:
mongodump --db student --collection detail --out c:\gowbackup

mongorestore –db student –collection detail c:\gowbackup\students.bson  
// now try drop database
db.students.drop()
