Mapping relational database to MongoDB
======================================
rdbms  --------------- mongodb
database---------------database
TABLES  ------------------collections
rows -------------------->documents (field:value,filed:value)
columns -------------------->fields

Collections in MongoDB is equivalent to the tables in RDBMS.
Documents in MongoDB is equivalent to the rows in RDBMS.
Fields in MongoDB is equivalent to the columns in RDBMS.

Fields (key and value pairs) are stored in document, 
documents are stored in collection and collections are stored in database.

This is how a document looks in MongoDB: As you can see this is similar 
to the row in RDBMS. The only difference is that they are in JSON format.

{
name:gowtham,
age:19,
hobbies:["","",""]
}

Table vs Collection
=====================
MongoDB automatically inserts a unique _id(12-byte field) 
field in every document, this serves as primary key for each document.

rdbms
table format

mongodb
json format

{
"_id":objectid("..."),
sno:
sname:
mark:
college:
}

{
"_id":objectid("..."),
sno:
sname:
mark:
}
.....
Another cool thing about MongoDB is that it supports dynamic schema which means 
one document of a collection can have 4 fields while the other document has only 3 fields. 
This is not possible in relational database.
